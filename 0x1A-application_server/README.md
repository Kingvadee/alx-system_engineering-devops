 * *For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:*

      [Web Server](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/17):computer: :globe_with_meridians: :electric_plug:

      [Server](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/67) :server:

      [Web stack debugging](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/68):bug: :computer: :wrench: :globe_with_meridians:
# Background Context:
 *  Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that you installed
    in your [first web stack project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/266). While a web server can also serve dynamic content,
    this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add
    this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make is serve your
    Airbnb clone project.
