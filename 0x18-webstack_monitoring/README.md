# “You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” :page_with_curl:is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoringhow our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we
will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

 * Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

   * Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure
it is behaving as expected   * Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making
sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

# RESOURCES TO REVIEW FOR THIS PROJECT :floppy_disk:

 * What is server monitoring [https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/server-monitoring/]
 * What is application monitoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management]
 * System monitoring by Google [https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/]
 * Nginx logging and monitoring [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/]

# CASE STUDY :page_with_curl:

Why is monitoring needed
What are the 2 main area of monitoring
What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
